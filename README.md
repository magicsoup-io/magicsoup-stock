# MagicSoup.io - Stock

THE base component library for your next React.js project. The *soup* is getting cooked with [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) and [styled-system](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system).

Inspired by [rebass](https://github.com/rebassjs/rebass) we at [zauberware](https://www.zauberware.com) created our own component starter library: **[MagicSoup.io](https://maqgicsoup.io)**!

**We love to code! We love to share! We love to create awesome UIs!**

Our goal is to animate more and more developers and companies to create higher order components with MagicSoup.io. We want to give the React.js community a space where they can share their components with others. If more and more developers are using the nice approach of styled-components, styled-system and MagicSoup.io, we will all get a better understanding of how others have build their UI and we can all easily hop into other projects.
